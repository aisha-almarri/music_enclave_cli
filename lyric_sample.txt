Verse 1:
Digital dreams in binary streams
Code and circuits, silent screams
In the machine, a human heart
Playing out its digital part

Chorus:
Secure enclave, protected space
Where musical ideas find their place
Encrypted files, checksums true
Preserving creative work for you

Verse 2:
Melodies born in silicon light
Protected through the darkest night
Timestamps mark the moment of birth
Digital music has proven its worth
